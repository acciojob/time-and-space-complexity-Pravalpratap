	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	 <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It's crucial to design algorithms with efficient time complexity to ensure optimal performance, especially for large datasets.

    <p>
        Space complexity, often denoted as <b>Space Complexity</b>, describes the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to solve a problem as a function of the input size. Algorithms with a space complexity of O(n) utilize a space proportional to the size of the input.
